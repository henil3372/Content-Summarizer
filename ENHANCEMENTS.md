# Application Enhancements

This document outlines the new features and improvements added to the Instagram Reel Summarizer application.

## Backend Enhancements

### 1. Query Parameter API Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/reels/process?url=INSTAGRAM_REEL_URL`

- Accepts video URL as a query parameter instead of request body
- Validates URL format and accessibility
- Returns JSON response with processId and status
- Supports the same Instagram URL validation as the POST endpoint

**Example**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/reels/process?url=https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "processId": "uuid-here",
  "status": "queued",
  "message": "Video processing started"
}
```

### 2. DELETE Endpoint for Process Management

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/reels/:id`

- Removes process entries from the filesystem
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (404, 200, 500)
- Validates process existence before deletion
- Prevents accidental deletion with confirmation required on frontend

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/reels/process-id
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Process deleted successfully",
  "id": "process-id"
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Process History API

- All job results now include `videoUrl` field
